Explain:
A minimum priority queue is a data structure that allows for efficient insertion and removal of elements with the smallest key value. In a complete binary tree, the element with the smallest key value will always be at the root.
To implement a minimum priority queue based on the complete binary tree above, we can use the following operations:
insert(): To insert an element into the minimum priority queue, we first add it to the next available spot in the tree, starting at the leftmost leaf and working our way up. Once the element is inserted, we compare its key value to its parent's key value. If the element's key value is smaller than its parent's, we swap the two elements. We continue comparing and swapping up the tree until the element is in the correct position, or until it reaches the root.

delMin(): To remove the element with the smallest key value from the minimum priority queue, we first remove the root element and replace it with the last leaf element. We then compare the key value of the new root element with its children. If the key value of the left or right child is smaller than the key value of the new root, we swap the root element with the child element. We continue to compare and swap down the tree until the element is in the correct position.

The time complexity of the insert() method in the minimum priority queue is O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the priority queue.

The basic idea behind this analysis is that in the worst case, the new key has to be inserted at the leaf of the binary tree, and then it needs to be compared and potentially swapped with its parent all the way up to the root. The height of a complete binary tree with n nodes is log(n), so the maximum number of comparisons and swaps that need to be done is log(n). Since each comparison and swap takes O(1) time, the overall time complexity is O(log n).

The time complexity of the delMin() method in the minimum priority queue is also O(log n).

This is because, in the worst case, the new root, which is the last element, needs to be compared and potentially swapped with its children all the way down to the leaf of the binary tree. As with the insert() method, the height of a complete binary tree with n nodes is log(n), so the maximum number of comparisons and swaps that need to be done is log(n). Since each comparison and swap takes O(1) time, the overall time complexity is O(log n).

It's important to notice that both operations are O(log n) even though we are using linkedlist underneath, as the basic operations i.e, comparision and swap are same as that of an array-based implementation and also the height of the tree is log(n) as it is a complete binary tree which is balanced

As a simple performance benchmark, we can test the time complexity of the insert() and delMin() methods by timing the execution of 1000 insertion and deletions on the priority queue. The results can be visualized using a line graph, with time on the y-axis and operations on the x-axis.
